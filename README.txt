## Installation
Download from the [WordPress.org themes directory](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/nightskyline) and install using [the instructions from the WordPress codex](https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes#Adding_New_Themes).

If you instead decide to download straight from GitHub be sure to run [`generate-css.sh`](https://github.com/mikemcquaid/NightSkyLine/blob/master/generate-css.sh) to generate the CSS `style.css` output from the SASS [`style.scss`](https://github.com/mikemcquaid/NightSkyLine/blob/master/style.scss) file.

## Caveats
The header image looks best if it is mirrored (as it repeats) and is black along the bottom edge (as it fades to the menu from black).
