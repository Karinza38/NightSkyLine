NightSkyLine
============

NightSkyLine is a clean, readable theme for WordPress with mobile support.

It has the following features/goals:

- Attractive design
- Readable text and layout
- Use advanced web standards where sensible (e.g. HTML5/CSS3)
- Minimal adaptions to look good on mobile devices
- Produce good printed output
- 404 manatee
- Only try and support newer browsers (e.g. not Microsoft Internet Explorer 7 and lower)

The header image looks best if it is mirrored (as it repeats) and is black along the bottom edge (as it fades to the menu from black).

[My homepage](http://mikemcquaid.com) is always running the latest version and the default header image (usually) is a photo of the skyline of wherever I'm living at the time.
