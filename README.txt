This is the theme I use for http://mikearthur.co.uk/

I've tried to keep it fairly generic but until I write some Wordpress
plugins then there's a few bits that are specific to my site. They
should be easy to modify though.

This has been adapted from the default Wordpress theme by
Michael Heileman.

The skyline reflects wherever I'm living at the time.
