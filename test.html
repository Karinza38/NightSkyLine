rel="bookmark" title="My Albums of 2010">My Albums of 2010</a></h2>
	<p class="postdate">January 4, 2011 @ 17:37</p>
		<p>Inspired by <a href="http://botherer.org/2011/01/01/things-of-the-year-2010-albums/">John</a>, <a href="http://www.stevelawson.net/2010/12/my-20-favourite-records-of-2010/">Steve</a> and <a href="http://blog.garethjmsaunders.co.uk/archives/2011/01/01/my-albums-of-2010/">Gareth</a> I thought I&#8217;d detail my favourite ten albums of 2010.</p>
<p>None of these were actually released in 2010 but they were my soundtrack to the year. The album titles link to Spotify or another location to listen online (where available).</p>
<h4><a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/6IVXrrveErrAS1tLw2ZzBN">Paradise Lost</a> (Symphony X, 2007)</h4>
<p><img src="http://mikemcquaid.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/paradiselost.jpg" alt="Paradise Lost album cover" /><br />
Based around John Milton&#8217;s poem of the same name, this was the first Symphony X album that has really grabbed me. I found their previous work filled with too much shred and not enough melody. That&#8217;s not to say the shredding here isn&#8217;t as crunchy and technically fantastic (Michael Romeo on excellent form) but here it ties a bit better into a cohesive album structure and helps to elevate songs rather than distracting from them. My highlight is probably the title track which with Russel Allen demonstrating his voice sounds even better when he isn&#8217;t thrashing it.</p>
<h4><a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/7q5ciKKgkOSCwUL3fEsIi4">Music Of The Spheres</a> (Mike Oldfield, 2008)</h4>
<p><img src="http://mikemcquaid.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/musicspheres.jpg" alt="Music Of The Spheres album cover" /><br />
The Songs Of Distant Earth is one of my favourite instrumental albums so I was interested to find out what Oldfield would produce when given a full orchestra to play with. The result is a beautiful and at times haunting album that doesn&#8217;t try to do too much. I&#8217;m no classical connoisseur but enjoyed this more than most classic music I&#8217;ve heard in years. Oldfield&#8217;s compositions bring me to a peaceful place and help me focus on higher things than the busyness of my day.</p>
<h4>A Tribute to The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway (Rewiring Genesis, 2008)</h4>
<p><img src="http://mikemcquaid.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/lambtribute.jpg" alt="A Tribute to The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway album cover" /><br />
I&#8217;m pretty skeptical about cover versions of songs and incredibly skeptical of projects like this that rerecord an existing album, particularly one I&#8217;m already a huge fan of. Something about Nick D&#8217;Virgillio&#8217;s varied vocals and the strange but brilliant addition of a horn section actually help to remind me what I loved to much about the original Lamb and produce one a re-imagining of an album I thought impossible to change without ruining.</p>
<h4><a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/65uz7Z8f6I90xKvxjm51iP">Wallstreet Voodoo</a> (Roine Stolt, 2005)</h4>
<p><img src="http://mikemcquaid.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/wallstreet.jpg" alt="Wallstreet Voodoo album cover" /><br />
This has been a year I&#8217;ve found myself pulled further into politics and examining the global recession and this album has been a soundtrack to that process. Released two years before the banking system started spiralling down the toilet some of the lyrics seem sadly prescient of what would occur. Neal Morse&#8217;s addition and the bluesy feel add variation to what would have already been an interesting album.</p>
<h4>On This Perfect Day (Guilt Machine, 2009)</h4>
<p><img src="http://mikemcquaid.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/perfectday.jpg" alt="On This Perfect Day album cover" /><br />
Most progressive rock I listen to is accused of being overcomplex and unemotional but anyone would struggle to say the same about Guilt Machine. This Arjen Anthony Lucassen side-project about the psychology of guilt found him and his current girlfriend (and lead guitarist on the album) creating something deeply personal about struggles they&#8217;ve overcome. I didn&#8217;t find it instantly accessible but the sheer passion and emotion that emerges from the album make it truly brilliant.</p>
<h4><a href="http://www.christophertin.com/callingalldawns.html">Calling All Dawns</a> (Christopher Tin, 2009)</h4>
<p><img src="http://mikemcquaid.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/callingalldawns.png" alt="Calling All Dawns album cover" /><br />
I found Christopher Tin through his writing of the menu track in Civilisation 4, a beautiful version of The Lord&#8217;s Prayer performed in Swahili by a gospel choir. The album tracks the changing periods of a day and each song is sung in a different language. I&#8217;m not normally into classical music but was entranced by the contrast between the tracks links and their impressive variety.</p>
<h4><a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/7khFXQNBzcfSfgGjPKerdE">Black Clouds and Silver Linings</a> (Dream Theater, 2009)</h4>
<p><img src="http://mikemcquaid.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/blackclouds.jpg" alt="Black Clouds and Silver Linings album cover" /><br />
I&#8217;ve been somewhat unimpressed with everything Dream Theater has done since Metropolis Part 2. There has been a few good tracks here and there, a few good riffs but it has just felt like the emotion and melody gave way to influences by boring metal. This album was a refreshing return to form with a variety that hasn&#8217;t been seen in an album other than Metropolis Part 2. The Count of Tuscany has an fantastic opening section where Petrucci manages to create something far prettier than he has in a long time by keeping his riffs simple and The Shattered Fortress brings a heavy but emotional conclusion to Portnoy&#8217;s Alcoholics Anoymous-themed suite. Sadly, Portnoy has now left the band so Dream Theater&#8217;s future is looking uncertain but I&#8217;m glad they got to release such a great album before that happened.</p>
<h4><a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/04fx29FcPvBXaYx1vvqSeh">The Human Equation</a> (Ayreon, 2004)</h4>
<p><img src="http://mikemcquaid.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/humanequation.jpg" alt="The Human Equation album cover" /><br />
Arjen Anthony Lucassen&#8217;s main project Ayreon is an awesome set of concept albums that have an overarching crazy science fiction plot and feature many guest instrumentalists and vocalists. The Human Equation is a bit different as it focuses on a man reliving his life in a whilst in a coma and tracks him through his various emotional states. James LaBrie from Dream Theater provides the main vocals and we see his character regret and eventually come to terms with his life before awakening. As with Guilt Machine I was drawn more to this album by the emotional connection with the characters and writers than Ayreon&#8217;s other work and even although this album does not feature my favourite Ayreon riffs or songs I feel it&#8217;s probably the best released so far.</p>
<h4><a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/5QkBiUHPiKY2KDfHBxJH8u">Space Metal</a> (Star One, 2002)</h4>
<p><img src="http://mikemcquaid.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/spacemetal.jpg" alt="Space Metal album cover" /><br />
Yet another Arjen Anthony Lucassen side project, I listened to this album a lot on Spotify before eventually buying the CD for £40 (as it was out of print) which illustrates how much I loved this. It&#8217;s heavily influenced by 70s and 80s Space Metal (hence the name) and is a lot more mainstream rock than the other prog here. The songs are each themed on a science fiction movie and stand alone so this is a concept album but without any linking between songs. This album has so many fantastic riffs and choruses that you can&#8217;t help but sing along (or at least try, I&#8217;m not exactly operatic). As a lover of pretty much everything Lucassen does it&#8217;s nice to see him write great songs rather than a great album and feature a consistent band between tracks. The 2010 followup Victims of the Modern Age is also very good but was released so late last year that it didn&#8217;t feel like it should quite make last year&#8217;s top 10.</p>
<h4>The Whirlwind (Transatlantic, 2009)</h4>
<p><img src="http://mikemcquaid.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/whirlwind.jpg" alt="The Whirlwind album cover" /><br />
When I heard Transatlantic were recording a new album I was beyond excited. Pete Trewavas, Mike Portnoy, Neal Morse and Roine Stolt are all great musicians in their own right whose contributions to their own bands are irreplaceable but it&#8217;s with Translatlantic they excel. There is a real sense of humility here, each musician allowing the space for everyone to get their centre stage moments but also coming together to produce incredible vocal and instrumental harmonies. The entire album is meant to be listened as a single continuous song and it really rewards the listener who does so; themes and riffs fade in and out, bringing almost instant familiarity. I was also lucky enough to see them live in London last year and they are as fantastic live as they are recorded.</p>

	<p class="postdate">November 11, 2010 @ 04:57</p>
		<p>I recently saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/">The Social Network</a>, a dramatisation of the creation of Facebook. It was a thoroughly enjoyable film with brilliant direction, casting (Eisenberg and Timberlake in particular) and writing. It also had an incredibly realistic hacking scene (using wget and perl scripts) and featured KDE on the desktop of most of the programmers in the film. I highly recommend seeing it, regardless of your thoughts on Facebook.</p>
<p>A friend sent me a <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/nov/25/generation-why/?pagination=false">link to an interesting review</a> that I was writing a long response to but thought I&#8217;d turn it into a blog post instead. The review is fantastically written by Zadie Smith but there&#8217;s a few glaring holes in it that frustrated this post into existence.</p>
<p>Smith, like many mainstream journalists and writers, seems to fundamentally understand what makes people like us excited about programming. I&#8217;ll respond to some choice quotes from the review.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;No doubt the filmmakers considered this option, but you can see their dilemma: how to convey the pleasure of programming—if such a pleasure exists—in a way that is both cinematic and comprehensible?&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>If such a pleasure exists? Really? She mentions in the review she talked to a &#8220;software expert&#8221; but she must have avoided this topic of discussion. The pleasure in coding combines creativity (like creating art, no-one will ever write a program the same way as you), building to try to simplify the lives of others and mathematical problem solving. I think the film communicates this fairly well but it&#8217;s one of these things that&#8217;s pretty much impossible to hide the elements of programming that immediately turn some people off it. Some people find the idea that I sit at my computer typing for most of the day fundamentally boring and there&#8217;s not much you can do to argue against this viewpoint other than display the great things that can result from it.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;E Pluribus Unum—that’s the point. Here’s my guess: he wants to be like everybody else. He wants to be liked.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s a shame that for anyone who is or was ever considered &#8220;nerdy&#8221; that we fall victim to such poor pop psychology. Just because we weren&#8217;t all deemed &#8220;cool&#8221; in high school doesn&#8217;t mean our entire careers are driven by this reductionist need to over-compensate for what others thing we missed out on. Zuckerberg I&#8217;d imagine, like most software engineers wants to build something that everyone will think &#8220;how did I manage before this came along&#8221; and, even if they don&#8217;t know he made it, he&#8217;ll know that he&#8217;s simplified the lives of a lot of people. This is why we do it and this is why we love it.</p>
<p>The fact that Zuckerberg open-sourced his earlier applications (not just gave it away for not monetary value, her review misses this) shows this; he values the pleasure of people using his tool over the monetary return that he could have instead. This also points to why Facebook didn&#8217;t take the many chances to sell out to large companies earlier in its existence.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;I am dreaming of a Web that caters to a kind of person who no longer exists. A private person, a person who is a mystery, to the world and—which is more important—to herself.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The type of web (and person) she mentions already existed and still exists: you can use private email, private Facebook messages, protected Twitter accounts and use other services that guarantee privacy, even relying on end-to-end encryption so only the sender and receiver can see any content. Arguably, this was the first web, the one many of us were using 10 or 15 years ago. The problem is that she fails to see the flip side of her argument: what about those of us who are very public people, how could we share things with the world without relying on a gatekeeper or third-party before the internet and, arguably, before Web 2.0&#8242;s concepts became mainstream?</p>
<p>This is why she&#8217;s writing her review in the New York Review and not by monetizing a personal blog. She seems to believe in the gatekeeper, the Web 1.0 (or Person 1.0 from her article) and the tight separation of career and personal life, of the private persona that lives their life and the public persona that does their work (or perhaps I&#8217;m the one who is spouting pop psychology now).</p>
<p>As said, this was a brilliantly written review even although I disagree with many of the arguments in it. The Social Network (and indeed Facebook itself) is a great advertisement for the beauty and power of software: that someone can produce something that will change the world from their university dorm room with scarce resources, no corporate sponsors, some programming experience and a lot of hard work. It&#8217;s the antithesis of programs like X Factor and other reality TV that spouts the lie to society that success comes from being lucky enough to be picked by a corporation and that fame itself is the thing worth striving for.</p>
<p>Start showing films like The Social Network in schools. Get high school kids writing software rather than the letters in Word. Teach them how to write Facebook and mobile applications, programs that they and their friends will use outside of school. Let us, as software engineers, rekindle the passion that got us into this field in the first place and let&#8217;s see a return to late-night coding binges and building useful stuff for fun. Let&#8217;s see the youth of tomorrow look at our field and think &#8220;wow, that&#8217;s cool, I want to do that too&#8221;.</p>

	<p class="postdate">September 26, 2010 @ 14:52</p>
		<p>It&#8217;s been over 4 months since the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2010">2010 UK elections</a>, the first election I&#8217;d say I researched to a significant level and followed closely. I watched many of the debates, interacted in many political discussions in person, on Facebook and on Twitter and consumed huge quantities of mainstream and social media discussion. It was a very strange election for a Liberal Democrat member; my party was thrust into the mainstream far more by the televised debates and ended up deciding who would form a government; finally deciding on forming one with the Conservatives.</p>
<p>I was initially pleased to think that the Lib Dems might provide a balancing influence to the Conservatives cuts and that the Conservatives approach to the deficit and cost-cutting was correct. The more I read and observed however the more I realised that looking through Keynesian economics paints another picture from that painted by Cameron and Osbourne. Seemingly overnight Clegg turned from being someone who has loudly condemned the Conservatives cuts to being the very man who has enabled them to happen. I would obviously prefer the current coalition over a Conservative government but, once all the LibDem flag-waving died down, I realised that this was one of three choices (LibLab coalition, LibCon coalition, minority Con government) and, as I see it today, Clegg chose the option I&#8217;m least happy with. The emergency budget and hard cuts simply could not have been made with a minority government and I&#8217;m not sure this would be a bad thing. After all, all parties seemed to agree cuts needed to be made, it was just a question of where and by how much.</p>
<p>If the massive cuts that are being pushed through cause the double-dip recession or society-breaking effect we all fear then it will hard to not look upon Clegg as similar to the main aspect of Blair I loathe: someone who should have been smart enough to avoid legitimising a horrible destruction of our values (Blair in Iraq, Clegg in the budget).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad the next election won&#8217;t be for quite a while as I&#8217;m currently conflicted about my Liberal Democrats membership. I doubt I will be renewing my membership this year and my vote could be anywhere from Labour (if Ed Miliband pulls the party left-ward) to the SNP (I believe an independent Scotland would be a more liberal one) to returning to the Lib Dems (if they manage to get some form of PR and the budget doesn&#8217;t decimate the services for the needy in society) in the next UK election.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m left with the increasing temptation toward apathy. The election was so frustrating in so many ways, particularly that no seat in Scotland changed hands and that the Lib Dems failed to turn brilliant results in the polls into actual parliamentary seats. However, if nothing else, hopefully this coalition signals an end of the Labour-Conservative back-and-forth that we&#8217;ve seen for all to long. I think the worse political situation for a country is the US-style two party system where you&#8217;re screwed if both parties agree on an issue and you don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I live in hope that people like Johann Hari and the Labour leadership are proved wrong and the coalition don&#8217;t inflict huge wounds on our society. For the moment, hoping and staying aware seems all that can really be done.</p>

rel="bookmark" title="Why I Left Linux and went to Apple">Why I Left Linux and went to Apple</a></h2>
	<p class="postdate">September 21, 2010 @ 20:17</p>
		<p>I originally bought a Macbook to use as a nice Linux laptop and for some iPhone and Qt OSX development. Shortly afterwards I got engaged which made me think about the future and how I spent my time a bit more. Linux is great for many use-cases but I just kept finding myself getting increasingly fed up with trying to use it on the desktop. My problems included having DVD playback not work quite correctly, having to manually edit configuration files in a text editor just to get some piece of hardware that worked instantly in OSX and Windows working and various other issues that wasted my time. Due to a kernel bug in Linux affecting my Macbook, I found myself using OSX more and more for work and finally moved across completely to my Macbook and also removing Linux from my desktop to relegate it to a Windows-only games machine. I&#8217;m now only running Linux on my NAS, this server, TV and phone.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a software engineer and I like writing code. I don&#8217;t mind doing sysadmin, I did it at my previous employer and do it on this server but my main love with computers will always be programming. Moving to OSX gave me a system that &#8220;Just Works&#8221; and resulted in me having more time to work on interesting coding projects and wasting less time trying to make my computer do what it is meant to.</p>
<p>I think the reason people become so passionate about Apple&#8217;s products is that they really focus on not bothering the user unless they have to through making sensible design decisions rather than worrying about edge cases (an unfortunate affliction for software engineers). A great example of this is the suspend behaviour. Firstly, suspend and resume on Mac is 100% reliable, I&#8217;ve never had my machine not come up after suspending. It&#8217;s quick, it occurs on you putting the lid down and it quickly becomes second nature to do so. Another great example of Apple&#8217;s design focus is what happens when your battery runs out after you&#8217;ve already put your lid down and suspended (<strong>UPDATE:</strong> This feature is know as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibernation_(computing)#Mac_OS_X">Safe Sleep</a> and combines hibernate and sleep. This is possible on Linux but isn&#8217;t default on any distribution I&#8217;ve ever used). On Windows (on older versions at least, haven&#8217;t tested this on 7) and on Linux: sucks, you shouldn&#8217;t have let your battery run out, you&#8217;ve lost all your work. On OSX: it hibernates automatically some time before the battery runs out so your work is saved.</p>
<p>I explained this to my wife and she asked &#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t everyone do it that way?&#8221;. I didn&#8217;t know. I suspect because it&#8217;s a hard problem and it doesn&#8217;t affect many people. The problem is that, although an edge case, when it does affect you it&#8217;s mindblowingly frustrating. When I use an Apple product it feels like they care about you enjoying your experience. They care if you lose work so they try and stop you doing so. On Linux, it just felt that whatever went wrong it was my fault for not RTFM. This came across from the OS itself and the developers and users I would ask for help.</p>
<p>Even if you use Linux or Windows, I encourage you to be influenced by Apple when you design your software: do the most sensible thing for the user at all times and don&#8217;t bother them. Don&#8217;t worry so much about edge cases and just try and transparently help the user without bothering them. This is why people pay a premium for Apple products. Better to make something that&#8217;s great at doing a few things in a way the user will love than possible to do everything if the user tries hard enough.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I didn&#8217;t mention the distribution I&#8217;ve used because the above applied to every one I had used at the stage I left. Even on well supported Dell hardware (Latitude D620) I never had 100% reliable suspend on Fedora, Debian, Kubuntu, OpenSUSE, Arch Linux or Gentoo. I bought the laptop for Linux as a friend had a Macbook; it was really well supported and worked great and he&#8217;s a kernel hacker so I thought it was a good bet. Turns out the newer version I bought had the above mentioned kernel bugs causing only one core to be usable (ACPI bug).</p>
